Rs. 5, Rs. 10, Rs. 50, Rs. 100. If the change is given to Pranav Rs. N is input, write a program
to computer smallest number of notes that will combine to give Rs. N.

Input format :
The first line of the input is an integer N, the change to be given to Pranav.

Output format :
The output should display the smallest number of notes that will combine to give N.

Refer sample input and output for formatting specifications.

Do not use any looping structures.

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
1200
Output 1 :
12
Input 2 :
242
Output 2 :
7
